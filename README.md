This is the command-line-interface (cli based) CINEMA TICKET BOOKING SYSTEM

Here you can choose the ticket types which are as follows:
  1. Premium Seat - 200
  2. Standard Seat - 150
  3. Economy Seat - 100

the user also has the option to select multiple tickets and can continue selecting tickets till the user enters 'n' or 'N'

in the end when the user enters 'n' or 'N', the program stops taking inputs from user 
for ticket selection and displays the total price of the tickets and if the total tickets are more than 5
the program applies a discount of 5% on the total amount and displays the discounted amount

This program was made by:
  • Vaibhav & Kamal (worked on the Code logic and syntax)
  • Sujal & Shaurya (helped with variable assignment and calculations)
